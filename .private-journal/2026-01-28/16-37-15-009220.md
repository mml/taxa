## Project Notes

Fixed ancestor insertion bug in sync.py:156-173. Changed from INSERT OR REPLACE to INSERT OR IGNORE to prevent overwriting complete taxon data with incomplete ancestor objects.

The bug affected non-leaf taxa (families, orders, etc.) that appeared both:
1. As regionally-discovered taxa (batch-fetched with full details)
2. As ancestors of other taxa (minimal details, no ancestors array)

After fix, all taxa now have proper parent rank data populated.
