## Project Notes

## Task 6: Database Schema - COMPLETE

Successfully completed Task 6 following strict TDD methodology:

### Implementation
- Created `/home/llm/src/taxa/.worktrees/flora-query-tool/src/taxa/schema.py` with `create_schema()` function
- Created `/home/llm/src/taxa/.worktrees/flora-query-tool/tests/test_schema.py` with two comprehensive tests

### Schema Design
The implementation includes:
1. **taxa table**: Comprehensive schema with all taxonomic ranks (kingdom through form), metadata fields (is_active, iconic_taxon)
2. **observations table**: Aggregated data with taxon_id/place_id composite key, foreign key to taxa
3. **regions table**: Metadata for geographic regions
4. **sync_info table**: Key-value storage for sync metadata

### Indexes Created
- idx_taxa_family, idx_taxa_genus, idx_taxa_subfamily, idx_taxa_tribe on taxa table
- idx_obs_region on observations table

### Test Results
- 25/25 tests passing (2 new schema tests + 23 existing)
- Commit: 69f3cb1 "feat: add database schema creation"

### TDD Process Followed
1. ✅ Write failing test
2. ✅ Verify test fails with import error
3. ✅ Implement schema creation
4. ✅ Run tests to verify pass
5. ✅ Commit with proper message

No questions arose - the specification was clear and complete.
