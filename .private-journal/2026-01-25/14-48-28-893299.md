## Project Notes

**Environment Setup for taxa project:**
- Using venv in worktree: `/home/llm/src/taxa/.worktrees/flora-query-tool/venv`
- Install: `venv/bin/pip install -e '.[dev]'`
- Run tests: `venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v`
- Run python: `venv/bin/python -m taxa.cli`
- **All subagents should use explicit venv paths** - no need to activate, just use full paths
- This avoids confusion about pipx vs pip vs global installs
