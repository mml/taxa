## Project Notes

**Venv setup complete** for taxa project:
- Created venv/, installed all deps with `venv/bin/pip install -e '.[dev]'`
- Updated both design and implementation plan docs with clear venv instructions
- All agents now use `venv/bin/pytest`, `venv/bin/python` explicitly
- No more confusion about pipx vs pip vs activation

**Task 3 completion notes:**
- Found bug in implementation plan: test 1 expected dict but implementation is generator
- Fixed test to consume generator with `list()` before assertions
- Fixed mock data: changed total_results from 100 to 1 to match single result
- Both tests now pass correctly
