## Project Notes

Task 8 CLI Framework - Fix Verification Complete

**Issue**: The original spec had `type=click.Path(exists=True)` on the sync command's config argument, which prevented the placeholder from running when config.yaml didn't exist.

**Fix Applied**: Commit bc9b76c removed the `type=click.Path(exists=True)` constraint, changing line 14 from:
```python
@click.argument('config', type=click.Path(exists=True), default='config.yaml')
```
to:
```python
@click.argument('config', default='config.yaml')
```

**Verification Results**:
✅ Command runs WITHOUT config.yaml present
✅ Command runs WITH config.yaml present  
✅ Command accepts custom config path arguments
✅ Help text shows [CONFIG] as optional argument
✅ Command still echoes the config path correctly

**Why This Is Correct**: This is a placeholder implementation. The actual validation of whether the config file exists should happen when the sync command is fully implemented in Task 10. For a placeholder that just prints messages, the file doesn't need to exist.
