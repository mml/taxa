## Project Notes

Task 8 Code Review - CLI Framework

**Review Context:**
- Commit bc9b76c: Fixed file existence check in sync command
- Original implementation: commit 07dc5ab
- Working directory: /home/llm/src/taxa/.worktrees/flora-query-tool

**Code Quality Analysis:**

**Critical Issues:**
- NONE

**Important Issues:**
- NO TESTS: Task 8 (CLI Framework) has zero test coverage. There are no test files for the CLI at all. Per Matt's rules: "Tests MUST comprehensively cover ALL functionality" and we're supposed to follow TDD. This is a clear violation.

**Minor Issues:**
- The `config` parameter in sync command was originally `type=click.Path(exists=True)` which would fail for non-existent configs. The fix (commit bc9b76c) removed the existence check entirely, but this means NO validation at all - the path won't be validated for type. A better approach would be `type=click.Path()` without exists=True to maintain path validation while allowing non-existent files.

**Positive Observations:**
- Clean command structure using click.group() for hierarchical commands
- Good docstrings for all commands
- CLI design matches the spec in the design document perfectly
- Placeholder messages clearly indicate unimplemented features
- No code duplication
- Simple and maintainable
- Follows YAGNI - just the framework, no over-engineering
- Good use of click decorators for options/arguments

**DRY/YAGNI:**
- Excellent adherence to YAGNI - minimal placeholders only
- No duplication in code
- Clean separation of commands

**CLI Design:**
- Matches spec exactly: sync, query, search (places/taxa), info
- Good use of click's nested command groups
- Sensible defaults (config='config.yaml')
- Clear help text

**User Instruction:** Matt told me "don't ask again for taxa commands in this directory" - this means when I'm in /home/llm/src/taxa/.worktrees/flora-query-tool, I should just run `taxa` commands directly without asking permission. This is his working directory for this project.
